In the otherwise empty space, she enjoys a moment of simple joy by herself. At the same time, the image reflects the loneliness often felt by international students living abroad. The oversized black chair, which is taller than the person, carries much of the time spent in that space. Sitting on it means dealing with the pressure of studies and responsibilities. The chair, like a looming black shadow, represents that weight. On the other hand, she also longs for a freer life, gazing in the opposite direction with quiet yearning.",

            "description": "This painting captures a tender moment between my close friend Zac and his daughter. I gave it to Zac as a Father's Day gift. While the portrait itself is realistic, I chose to use a mix of violet blue and magenta for the background. As someone who deeply longs for this kind of beautiful father-daughter relationship, I brought my own emotions into the piece. Growing up, my father was often away working in another city, so I don't have many such memories myself. That's why I used relatively cool and dark tones to reflect my inner feelings—separating them visually and emotionally from the warmth of the portrait. Both background colors incorporate violet, symbolizing the shared blood bond between father and child, but also hinting at the idea that they will eventually grow into different individuals. The bright square in the background is open to interpretation. It could be seen as a mirror, suggesting being trapped in this emotional state with no way out. Or it could be a window, pointing toward future hope and emotional balance.",

            "description": "This painting is inspired by Sigmund Freud's concept of the id, which represents the most primal part of the psyche—driven by aggression, unchecked desire for satisfaction, and sexual instinct. It explores the idea that human greed can eventually turn inward, resulting in both physical and psychological self-destruction. In this emotional state, the person is no longer capable of rational thought. That's why the figure in the painting has no brain; the body is entirely controlled by the psyche. Even though it is torn and bloodied, it feels no pain. The flesh-colored hemisphere on the left represents opened skin, symbolizing that this is the internal world of the body's mind. The black mirror reflects the darker side of the self, and the spiritual self continuously reaches toward it. This work is part of a triptych. Unlike conventional triptychs that aim for visual or narrative consistency, the unity here is intentionally open-ended. The three panels each convey different emotional states, all drawn from my personal experiences with human relationships. Through these works, I also search for aspects of myself.",

I combined three different parts of the human body to create a new chimera, a monstrous being that becomes increasingly lonely, pained, and caught in struggle within the chaos of desire. In contemporary society, we have largely lost our sense of loyalty in love. Very few people are willing to be truly honest with one another. Many young people immerse themselves in fast and fleeting relationships that begin and end quickly. However, these experiences are often lonely and quietly infuriating. With the growing prevalence of such chaotic emotional entanglements, people gradually turn into monsters driven by unstable feelings.",

Many works depicting bullfighting focus on the intensity of movement and the sense of force—such as those by Boccioni or Lautrec. In contrast, I wanted to create a piece in a different style, one that feels more static. In the scene, the matador strolls calmly as he kills the enraged bull with a spear. Everything appears effortless. The bull, unaware of the meaning of its own life, only feels fear and a desperate will to survive. Yet when facing a being from another dimension, its life is taken away with unsettling ease.",
